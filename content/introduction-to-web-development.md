# Introduction to Web Development: A Comprehensive Guide

Welcome to the world of **Web Development**! In this tutorial, we will walk you through the basics of how websites work and the tools used to build them, all the way to creating your first website.

## What is Web Development?

Web development is the process of building, creating, and maintaining websites. It encompasses several aspects including web design, web programming, and database management.

### Frontend vs Backend Development

Web development is generally divided into two main parts:

- **Frontend**: Everything a user sees (HTML, CSS, JavaScript).
- **Backend**: Server-side logic, databases, and APIs (Node.js, Python, PHP).

## HTML Basics

HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard language for creating web pages.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>My First Webpage</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Welcome to My Website</h1>
    <p>This is a paragraph of text on my website.</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

## CSS for Styling

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to style your webpage and make it look attractive.

```css
body {
  font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
  background-color: #f4f4f4;
}

h1 {
  color: #333;
}
```

## JavaScript for Interactivity

JavaScript allows you to add interactive elements to your website.

```javascript
function greet() {
  alert("Hello, welcome to my website!");
}
```

## Building Your First Website

By combining HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, you can build your very first interactive website.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>My First Website</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css" />
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>My First Website</h1>
    <button onclick="greet()">Click Me</button>

    <script src="script.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

## Conclusion

Youâ€™ve now learned the fundamentals of web development. Keep practicing and experimenting with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to enhance your skills!
